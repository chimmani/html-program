    Sports dramas are a dime a dozen, and bad sports dramas are, sadly, just as many. So, you cannot blame a viewer if they approach any film that markets itself as one with skepticism or just plain indifference. But to call Nagesh Kukunoor's Good Luck Sakhi a sports drama, good or bad, is ungenerous and, more importantly, inaccurate. Yes, there is a sport in the middle of it allâ€”shooting, but it is merely a device to help Sakhi (Keerthy Suresh) understand the world beyond her village and her place in it. See it as a coming-of-age tale of a woman, and you might find the daily soap level low stakes familiar and comforting. Which is to say you can watch it in the background and still not miss the few points it tries to make.
